# Release Chronicle - December 2025

This release marks a significant milestone in the evolution of the Antigravity Microanalyst system, transitioning from a monolithic orchestration layer to a highly modular, registry-based "Cognitive Swarm" architecture.

## 🚀 New Features

### 🧠 Cognitive Swarm Upgrade (P0-P3)
- **Modular Registry Pattern**: Refactored the monolithic `AgentCoordinator` into a thin orchestration layer using the Registry and Blackboard patterns. Business logic is now modularized into specialized task handlers.
- **Adaptive Personas**: Enhanced agents with specialized logic for Technical, Sentiment, Risk, and Macro analysis.
- **Institutional Command Center (V6)**: Launched a professional-grade Prediction Visualizer for real-time market intelligence and signal tracking.
- **Liquidation Intelligence (Vision)**: Integrated behavioral intelligence and liquidation heatmap analysis into the core reasoning engine.

### 📈 Intelligence & ML
- **Paper Trading Engine**: Implemented a simulated trading environment to validate agent hypotheses without financial risk.
- **Synthetic Volatility (GARCH)**: Integrated advanced statistical modeling for better risk quantification.
- **Unified ML Dataset**: Established a PredictionAgent and BaseAgent abstraction to unify feature engineering across all intelligence nodes.

### 🌐 Server & Connectivity
- **REST API Overhaul**: Implemented comprehensive FastAPI endpoints for health checks, market thesis retrieval, and SSE log streaming.
- **Real-time SSE Logs**: Users can now stream live system reasoning and agent debate logs directly to the frontend.

## 🐛 Bug Fixes
- **Adversarial Debate Stability**: Fixed logic errors in `debate_swarm.py` where undefined variables caused crashes during parallel node execution.
- **Formal Logic Repairs**: Aligned code implementation with docstrings using the Clover 'Trifecta' methodology.
- **Diagram Syntax**: Corrected Mermaid diagram syntax in system documentation.

## 🧹 Internal Cleanup
- **Comprehensive Documentation**: Added Google-style docstrings to all server-layer components and generated a complete `API_DOCUMENTATION.md`.
- **Frontend i18n**: Implemented a localized translation system (English) for the React frontend, removing all hardcoded UI strings.
- **Tech Debt Elimination**: Performed a full-system audit and created a strategic `TECH_DEBT_REPORT.md` for future refactoring efforts.
