# Data Quality & System Health Report (V5.1)

**Execution Date**: 2025-12-20
**Overall Health**: 🟢 OPERATIONAL (with minor serialization caveats)

## 📊 Data Fidelity Audit

### Institutional Grade Metrics
- [x] **Price (OHLCV)**: Verified 1h/1d persistence. Success.
- [x] **Volatility (GARCH)**: `synthetic_iv_garch` populated. Success.
- [x] **On-Chain**: `mempool_vbytes` and fees populated. Success.
- [ ] **ETF Flows**: Stale. `btcetffundflow_holdings.html` missing in latest run. (Dependency: Upstream source accessibility).

### ML Dataset Unification
- **Vision Integration**: Vision metrics (liquidation clusters) correctly mapped to the feature vector during `AgentCoordinator` execution.
- **Broadcasting**: `is_inference=True` logic verified. Latest context correctly broadcasted across features.

## 🧠 Cognitive Swarm Assessment

The adversarial debate between Retail, Institutional, and Whale agents successfully utilized the `PredictionAgent`'s T+24h forecast as a baseline.

### Key Observation: Mixed Signals Handling
- The `Facilitator` correctly identified "Mixed signals" during the `HOLD` decision, demonstrating robust skepticism rather than forced directionality.
- **Log Extract**: *"Facilitator sided with Consensus. Fractal: Neutral - Divergence noted."*
